# PC1T-Project
This repository contains project  for the BPC-PC1T course at Brno University of Technology from 2020.
The project is a console application for managing reservations in multiplexes. It is possible to choose a movie, time and then select a specific seat from the virtual hall where already reserved seats are displayed. Once the seat is confirmed, a unique ticket code is generated.
